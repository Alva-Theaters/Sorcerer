<!--
Following Blender's lead on this, keeping this short and concise. Seems like a good idea
since this way, we can put all the efforts towards one place, the main website. Previously,
there were issues where the website would be up to date, but this readme was very
different and old, or the other way around. This way there is only one primary communicator 
to maintain.

Alva Sorcerer
==============
Sorcerer is a Blender add-on intended for theatrical lighting designers who struggle with the procedural complexity of conventional lighting consoles. Blender is ["the free and open source 3D creation suite. It supports the entirety of the 3D pipeline-modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing, motion tracking and video editing."](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/) Sorcerer links many of Blender's editors directly to ETC Eos, including:

- **3D Viewport:** Control lights with 3D objects
- **Video Sequence Editor:** Sequence timecode events intuitively
- **Node Editor:** Add as many ML Editors as desired
- **Graph Editor:** Adjust fade curves with near-analog precision
- **Text Editor:** Generate Eos macros using QWERTY and Copy/Paste
