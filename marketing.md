Imagine an absurdly sophisticated, effortlessly intuitive, exotically bizarre entertainment lighting software designed by aliens from a distant planet. Imagine this software is capable of doing things with lights that make our expensive lighting consoles shake in their boots. Imagine that using this software as an artist is so intuitive that it feels the same as painting with a paint brush, playing piano, or writing poetry. That’s what Alva Sorcerer is trying to be. It’s not trying to be just another DMX software. It’s not just trying to make a few steps forward. It’s trying to radically redefine extraordinary. 

Alva Sorcerer is a cool new tool that helps you get your professional lighting console to do way cooler stuff. Sorcerer is almost a full-blown lighting console in and of itself, but it’s just a remote-controller. 

You want to use Sorcerer because its UI is way more intuitive than the console. You also want Sorcerer because it’s part of Blender and Blender’s 3D view, sequencing, and node editor tools give us way more power over the lights than we can get with just the plain old console by itself. Sorcerer is kind of like training wheels for the lighting console, but the training wheels are jet packs too.

Here, we’ll focus just on Sorcerer’s lighting tools, but remember that Sorcerer also does live 3D audio. The main thing you’ll be working with inside Sorcerer is controllers. Controllers make the lights do stuff.


Controllers:

Brush: This is a 3D object you push through fixtures in 3D view to brush color, intensity, and other parameters onto fixtures. When the object leaves, the changes stay.

Influencer: This is a 3D object you push through the scene to make it look like objects are moving through the lights. They’re similar to brush controllers, but the changes go away when the influencer leaves.

Stage Object: This is basically just a group, but instead of saying “Group 1 at Full Enter” to take the group to full, you just drag the object you want to light upwards to make it light up.

Flash Strip: These are color strips inside the video editor that let you sequence flash effects to timecode in 5 seconds—on ETC Eos family lighting consoles. 

Macro Strip: These color strips allow you to define ETC Eos macros using  normal QWERTY keys and then trigger them at the start and/or end frame of the strip.

Animation Strip: These make it super easy to sequence extremely precise lighting animations to music. Animation is different from “programming” because animation gives you the precision you need to make lights seem like they have feelings. “Programming” is geeky computer syntax and animation is organic artistic flow.

Cue Strips: These have little cue builders inside them that make it extremely easy to build the basics of most cues, particularly in live music settings. The length of the strip is the duration of the cue transition.

Group Controller Node: These are basically just compact ML editors, but you can have as many on screen as you want controlling different lights. They can also link to each other to make groups of groups. These are basically just hyper-customizable ML editors. Using these is like sculpting: if you want to change stuff, you just change it. You don’t have to select it first.

Mixer Node: These are like group controller nodes, only instead of giving you just one choice for each parameter, you get as many choices for each parameter as you want. The mixer then mixes your choices across the group.



New Tools:

Animation: Most numbers in Sorcerer are animatable. This means you can make any value be whatever you want at any time—without cues, effects, macros, timecode events, or anything complicated like that. You just hit the I key to keyframe it.

Orb: The orb is here to automate repetitive tasks on the console. The orb is any button with the Alva Sorcerer orb logo. The orb commandeers the lighting console through OSC. The orb creates macros for you, patches lights for you, sets up your entire event list for you, and records qmeos for you.

Qmeos: These are like videos, but each frame of the video is a lighting cue, not a picture. We need these to be able to store the extremely precise Blender animation data onto the lighting console. These are created automatically by Orb. When it’s done, you just fire the cue on the console and the console plays back the lighting animation completely by itself.



Benefits:

No Losses: When you choose to use Sorcerer, you aren’t losing your professional lighting console. You’re supplementing it. You can choose to use Sorcerer to help you with one small task and just that one small task, or you can choose to design your entire show with Sorcerer and only touch the lighting console once or twice.

Mature and Robust: Because Sorcerer is built on top of Blender, its backbone is extremely mature and robust from 30 years of iterative development. This means you get extremely high quality in file management, in UI/UX, and in support communities from the Blender-specific aspects of Sorcerer. 

Reduced Technicals: Sorcerer’s UI/UX is designed with middle-school theatre in mind. This means that extensive effort has gone into making bleeding-edge tools that are as intuitive as they can possible be. 

Break the Rules: Sorcerer allows you to control lights in ways that feel illegal. It lets you do things with lights that no other platform lets you do. At least half a dozen of its controller types have no comparable analog in any other known software or console. Sorcerer lets you break rules you didn’t realize were holding you back. 

ALVA: Alva, or Animated Lighting, Video, and Audio, is the big picture version of Sorcerer. Adopting Sorcerer ensures you don’t miss out on the extremely exciting future where full-blown ALVA becomes real and widespread. Full-blown-ALVA technology is how Alva Sorcerer wants to radically redefine extraordinary.
