Hello there, human! 

This is a Blender 4 add-on called Alva Sorcerer. Sorcerer is intended for stage lighting designers using timecode. Sorcerer is a time-coding tool that lets you animate stage lights with keyframes and fire timecode events with a video editor, node editor, and 3D view. It does not output DMX. It remote-controls professional lighting consoles that have OSC input libraries. This means you do not have to sacrifice the console you already have in order to use a timeline-based editor. Many bonus functions in this software only work for ETC Eos family consoles. However, some of the features are compatible with other consoles (nodes likely work with most, but only Eos has been tested).

To use this software, you must download and install a recent version of Blender from blender.org. Currently, the exact url to go to is:

https://www.blender.org/download/

If you found the correct download file, you should be able to double-click it and your operating system should walk you through the install process smoothly.

Once you have Blender downloaded and installed, you will need to go to User Preferences to tell Blender to run Sorcerer. On the top left, Edit > Preferences. Then, at the top, press the “Add-ons” tab button. Then, go to the bottom left corner and press “Install”. Then, find the compressed “Sorcerer” folder. Ensure the compressed/zipped folder is still named Sorcerer with no spaces, capital letters, or special characters. Click that in the Blender add-on window and it should pop up as an add-on. Go ahead and check the checkbox to enable the add-on and read the warnings. Essentially, it just lets you know that it isn’t necessarily safe to have this software actually running during a real show with an audience, that it’s far better to store the data created by this software locally on the console. There are many automation tools in Sorcerer to help you with that. Here is that formal warning:

Warning: For optimal performance and reliability during live shows, it's advised to transfer all timings created with this software directly to the console's internal memory prior to the event. While this add-on is a valuable tool for setting up and integrating into an FOH setup, it's not recommended to have Blender/Sorcerer actively running and sending OSC commands during the live show itself. Follow best practices for a seamless experience.

If installing Sorcerer did not work as expected and you can’t figure out what’s going on, Googling it may help (type in keywords for general Blender add-on installation problems). If that doesn’t work, contact Alva Theaters at help@alvatheaters.com.

Once you have Sorcerer installed, navigate either to 3D view, Video Editing, the Shader Editor, or the Sorcerer Nodes view. 

Now, follow intuition, tooltips, and the demo videos/streams on Alva Theaters’ YouTube channel to figure out what to do with the software. If none of that helps, either contact Alva by email at help@alvatheaters.com, by phone at (855) 512-2700, or, maybe you’ll be forced to read the documentation. It is our goal however to create software that is so intuitive that it doesn’t need documentation/instructions. If you feel the need to vent about something you think is needlessly confusing and/or dumb, send us an email at thisisdumb@alvatheaters.com. You can also ask our Not a Dumb Chatbot.
